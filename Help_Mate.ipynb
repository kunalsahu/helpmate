No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b.

A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b.

This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial. This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART IV - BENEFITS GC 6018 Section D - Claim Procedures, Page 1\",\n          \"A claimant may request an appeal of a claim denial by Written request to The Principal within 180 days of receipt of notice of the denial. The Principal will make a full and fair review of the claim. The Principal may require additional information to make the review. The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request. If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal. However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \\\"claimant\\\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy. The Principal will pay for any such autopsy. Article 7 - Legal Action Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted. Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be filed. Article 8 - Time Limits Any time limits in this section will be adjusted as required by law.

If a Member who was insured dies within the 31-day individual purchase period described in PART III, Section F, The Principal will pay his or her beneficiary the individual policy amount, if any, the Member had the right to purchase. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named. Article 4 - Facility of Payment If any of the below occur, benefits will be paid as stated. All such payments will discharge The Principal to the full extent of those payments. a. If a beneficiary is found guilty of the Member's death, such beneficiary may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to any contingent beneficiary or to the executor or administrator of the Member's estate. b. Any benefit due a beneficiary who dies before the Member's death will be paid in equal shares to the Member's surviving beneficiaries.

The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.
